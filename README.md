# SUMMARY OF EXCEPTIONS HANDLING OF MY APPROACH
---------------------------------------------

The provided ExceptionHandler program demonstrates robust exception handling for various scenarios. Each exception type is addressed in a specific method, ensuring proper error detection, reporting, and graceful recovery. 
Here's a summary of how each exception is handled:

## IOException:
Triggers while reading a file. Ensures non-empty filenames and gracefully handles errors like missing or unreadable files.

## FileNotFoundException:
Catches missing file errors when attempting to open a file.

## EOFException:
Handles unexpected end-of-file scenarios during data stream operations.

## SQLException:
Demonstrates database connection error handling by attempting to connect using user-provided credentials.

## ClassNotFoundException: 
Validates and reports errors when a specified class is missing or cannot be loaded.

## ArithmeticException:
Prevents division by zero through careful exception handling during arithmetic operations.

## NullPointerException:
Detects and reports null object access attempts.

## ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: 
Validates array indices and handles invalid access attempts.

## ClassCastException: 
Demonstrates handling of invalid type-casting scenarios.

## IllegalArgumentException:
Validates method arguments like negative sleep times, ensuring proper usage.

## NumberFormatException: 
Safeguards against invalid string-to-number conversions.

Each exception-handling block provides meaningful feedback to the user, enhancing the program's robustness and user experience.
